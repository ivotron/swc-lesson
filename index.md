[Popper](http://falsifiable.us) is an experimentation protocol and CLI 
tool for conducting experiments and writing academic articles 
following best 
[OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and 
[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) practices. The 
[open-source CLI tool](https://github.com/systemslab/popper) helps 
researchers organize all the artifacts associated to a scientific 
exploration inside a code repository such as Git. These “popperized” 
repositories are self-contained and can be easily shared (cloned via 
Git) so that others can replicate the original results (see examples 
[here](https://github.com/popperized)).

> ## Prerequisites
>
> In this lesson we use the [Unix 
> Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice), and previous 
> experience is highly recommended before taking this lesson. We 
> assume you are familiar with tasks such as listing directories, 
> creating, copying, remove and listing files, as well as modifying 
> file permissions and running scripts. We also make use of 
> [Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice) (and Github) basic 
> features such as creating commits and pushing to remote repos. In 
> addition, we also make basic use of 
> [Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation) 
> and [Docker](https://ome.github.io/training-docker), which we also 
> encourage you to learn before taking this lesson.
